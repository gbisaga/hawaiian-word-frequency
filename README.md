# hawaiian-word-frequency
This is a simple project that presents the top X words in Hawaiian, as determined by scanning the newspaper archive at http://www.nupepa.org/. Most newspapers are before 1914. For consistency, I convert everything to the old-style (kahiko) writing, without kahako or 'okina. However, I have not found this to be a major impediment for using the list as a learning aid.
# How do I use it?
Download the top-X file you want. Go thru the list, starting from the beginning, and see which words you don't know. Look them up on https://hilo.hawaii.edu/wehe/ to find their usages in context. Then put then in anki and learn them. Rinse and repeat.
